# Rocket-nozzle-Analysis
This MATLAB Project essentially analyzes the relationship between nozzle expansion ratio and thrust in a propulsion system. Using isentropic flow equations, it calculates exit pressure, exhaust velocity, and thrust for varying nozzle geometries. Provides insight into optimal nozzle design for rocket propulsion systems.
